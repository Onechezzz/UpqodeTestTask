# UpqodeTestTask
Hello, I am glad to welcome you to the repository with the completed test task.
Here are few remarks for better understanding:
1.I made header with background color != transparent for better looking. Because default color isn`t visible at all.
2.Google Maps declined my access caused highlighted credit is over & need Billing on the Google Cloud Project. That is a reason why markers don`t work properly. 
Hope that task is completed well=)
